	/// documentation for each event field and its parameters is added to a node's metadata so it
	/// can be used by external interfaces or tools.
	///
	///	The `generate_deposit` macro generates a function on `Pallet` called `deposit_event` which
	/// will convert the event type of your pallet into `RuntimeEvent` (declared in the pallet's
	/// [`Config`] trait) and deposit it using [`frame_system::Pallet::deposit_event`].

	///
	/// Errors tell users that something went wrong so it's important that their naming is
	/// informative. Similar to events, error documentation is added to a node's metadata so it's
	/// equally important that they have helpful documentation associated with them.

	/// They must always return a `DispatchResult` and be annotated with a weight and call index.
	///
	/// The [`call_index`] macro is used to explicitly
	/// define an index for calls in the [`Call`] enum. This is useful for pallets that may
	/// introduce new dispatchables over time. If the order of a dispatchable changes, its index
	/// will also change which will break backwards compatibility.
